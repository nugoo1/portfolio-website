# My Portfolio Website
Inspired by Sean Halpin (seanhalpin.io)

## Tools Used
This project was made using react, more specifically the react-create-app module.


## npm
`npm init react-app my-app`
`cd my app`
`yarn start`


### Deployment
This is currently deployed on heroku at https://salty-spire-79634.herokuapp.com/. It's a bit slow to start up the server (sleeping dynos as it's a free server), but once it does start, it should function like a standard react application; which means it should run really fast since all the pages are loaded at once. Just a single handshake with the server, so you won't be reloading pages and communicating with the server every time you navigate to another page. This is something I love about react.


### Notes
I will be moving this to a permanent domain as soon as development is done (development never actually ends, but once I put up the rest of my work,
I will be moving the website to my private domain - www.stem.lk).
