# My Portfolio Website
Inspired by Sean Halpin (seanhalpin.io)

## Tools Used
This project was made using react, more specifically the react-create-app module.

### Deployment
This is currently deployed on heroku (sleeping dynos), so it's a bit slow.
I will be moving this to a permanent domain as soon as development is done (development never actually ends, but once I put up the rest of my work,
I will be moving the website to my private domain - www.stem.lk).

## npm
`npm init react-app my-app
cd my app
yarn start`
